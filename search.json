    "text": "Methods\n\nI mainly wanted to focus on text analysis using the ntlk package and focusing on the titles and mediums of the works. To do so, I stemmed the words and removed stopwords and punctuations in those columns, then performed text analysis on them. For the mediums, I first identified the top five most frequent words that appeared in the column then graphed their frequencies over time. For the titles, I performed a sentiment analysis where I computed the sum of compound sentiment scores from titles in each year and plotted them on a bar graph. I added a color code to illustrate which periods of time had more negative sentiments and which ones had more positive sentiments.\nAfter further exploring the data, I realized the artworks have two important dates for each work: the year the work was produced and the year the work was acquired by the Museum. For most of my visualizations, which I plot over time to examine specific shifts in a variable across the artworks over time, I plotted graphs for both the year produced and the year acquired. I added a column to the artworks dataset for the year to streamline this process, and did some data cleaning (took out white space and unneccessary puntuation, singled out a year from each entry) on the ‘Data’ column. Additionally, I utilized plotly to animate the acquisitions according to each department over time.\n\nIn order to rearrange the data for specific visualizations, I created lists and new dataframes to plot them more effectively. I often had to group the data and apply functions to sum or count the values according the groupings, and then stored them into dataframes so I could plot them. I also decided to make separate dataframes for each gender in my analysis to identify any patterns in each respective gender distribution.\nFor my geographic data, I analyzed the nationality variable in the artists dataset. I imported two datasets: a dataset from github that matched nationalities to countries and a dataset from folium that helps me map out the frequencies according to each country using the folium package. I ended up not mapping out the nationalities per artwork since some artworks were produced by multiple artists, and it would have been too complex to separate each nationality and compute the frequencies accordingly."

The dynamic between solo works and group works would be an interesting dynamic to investigate in terms of cultural shifts between the 20th and 21st centuries. * The date produced column has some unneccessary information such as the century or extra dates that make it difficult to plot data visualizations. Processing and extracting years from each column can allow for use of as much as the artworks as possible. The date acquired is in date (YYYYMMDD) format which is really helpful and requires no processing aside from removing null values. The processing for both the date produced and acquired will not be done directly on this dataset but performed on a copy which will be in the focused analysis. * The medium column is quite detailed but it would be interesting to stem and remove stop words from each string and process the words to identify mediums with the highest frequency in the dataset. * I decided not to examine the dimensions since works vary from 2D to 3D, and it would get too complicated as well as does not serve much relevance to my research topics. I decided to focus more on other aspects of the dataset.\n\ndfartists['Gender'] = dfartists['Gender'].str.lower()\n\n\ngender = dfartists['Gender']\ndfgender = gender.value_counts(dropna = False).to_frame()\ngenderplot = dfgender.plot.pie(subplots = True, figsize=(12,5), autopct='%1.2f%%', colors = ['lightblue', 'yellowgreen', 'pink', 'purple'], title = 'Gender Breakdown of MoMA Artists')\n\n\n\n\nAbove is a pie chart showing the gender breakdown of MoMA artists, including those who have no recorded gender. Around 20% of the artists in the dataset have no recorded gender which is surprisingly more than the percentage of female artists (15%). Male artists dominate the collections, making up 64% of the artists. There is a negligible amount of non-binary artists (less than 0.02%), and no other genders recorded (eg. transgender, genderfluid, etc.).\nMale artists are far more recognized in the collection than women and LGBTQ+ artists. There is little to further examine here in terms of LGBTQ+ representation, but looking into the relationships of male and female artists across other aspects of the data seems promising in the focused analysis.\n\nmyStopWords = list(punctuation) + stopwords.words('english')\nnumWords = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']\ndfartworks['Medium'] = dfartworks['Medium'].str.lower()\nfor c in punctuation:\n  dfartworks['Medium'] = dfartworks['Medium'].str.replace(c, ' ')\ndfartworks = dfartworks.astype({'Medium':'string'})\ndfmed = dfartworks['Medium'].dropna()\nmedwordlist = []\nfor i in dfmed:\n    for w in i.split():\n        if w not in myStopWords and w not in numWords and (not w.isnumeric()):\n            medwordlist.append(PorterStemmer().stem(w))\n\ndfmed = pd.DataFrame(nltk.FreqDist(medwordlist).most_common(20), columns= ['Words', 'Frequency']).sort_values('Frequency')\nplt.barh(dfmed['Words'], dfmed['Frequency'], color='lightcoral')\nplt.title(\"Most Frequent Mediums Mentioned in MoMA Collection\")\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_285/1717094725.py:5: FutureWarning:\n\nThe default value of regex will change from True to False in a future version.

We can see that prints make up the majority of the collection (over 50,000). The top 10 also appear to all be mediums in a 2 dimensional space. It would be interesting to examine the frequency of these words in the artworks respective to the date they were acquired, seeing if most of these 2-dimensional mediums continue to be acquired or happened to be some of the first items entering the collection.\n\nartistdist = dfartworks['Artist']\nartistdistdf = artistdist.value_counts().to_frame()\nartistdistdf.head(20).sort_values('Artist').plot.barh(title = 'Artists with the Most Works in MoMA Collection')\n\n&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'Artists with the Most Works in MoMA Collection'}&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot of the artists with the mostworks in the collection is Eugene Atget, a photographer from Paris. We can see the leading artists with the most works also happen to photographers (aside form Louise Bourgeois who experimented with multiple mediums). There is not much to conclude from here aside from which artists dominate the collection, so there will not be a focused analysis on this.\n\ndates = []\ndfartworks = dfartworks.astype({'Date':'string'})\nfor c in punctuation:\n  dfartworks['Date'] = dfartworks['Date'].str.replace(c, ' ')\ndfartworks['Date'] = dfartworks['Date'].str.replace('s', ' ')\ndfartworks['Date'] = dfartworks['Date'].str.replace('–', ' ')\ndfartworks['Date'] = dfartworks['Date'].str.lower()\n\nfor i in range(len(dfartworks)):\n   if (not pd.isna(dfartworks['Date'][i])):\n      for w in dfartworks['Date'][i].split():\n        if (not pd.isna(w)) and w.isnumeric() and len(w) == 4:\n          dfartworks['Date'][i] = w\nindex = 0\nfor w in dfartworks['Date']:\n   if (not pd.isna(w)) and w.isnumeric() and len(w) == 4:\n          dates.append(int(w))\ndates.sort()\ntimeseries = np.unique(dates, return_counts=True)\nplt.plot(timeseries[0], timeseries[1])\nplt.title('Artworks Produced Over Time')\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_285/1123902068.py:4: FutureWarning:\n\nThe default value of regex will change from True to False in a future version.

We can see MoMA stays true to its mission in acquiring works that were produced in the early 1900s (modern art) to 2000s (contemporary art). However, we can clearly see MoMA has a strong tendency to acquire majority of works produced in the mid 1900s. It would be interesting to examine the production dates in terms of their themes and identify positive/negative sentiments in the focused analysis.\n\ndfworks = dfartworks.copy()\nnotyears = []\ndfworks['Date'].dropna(inplace = True)\nfor w in dfworks['Date']:\n    if (not pd.isna(w)) and not w.isnumeric() and len(w) != 4 and w not in notyears:\n        notyears.append(w)\nfor i in notyears:\n    dfworks = dfworks[dfworks['Date'] != i]\ndfworks = dfworks[dfworks['Date'] != \"n d \"]\n\n\ndfgender_year = dfartists[['Gender', 'BeginDate', 'EndDate']].dropna()\ndfgender_year = dfgender_year[dfgender_year['EndDate'] != 0]\ndfgender_year = dfgender_year[dfgender_year['BeginDate'] != 0]\ndfgender_year['Age'] = dfgender_year.apply(lambda row: row.EndDate - row.BeginDate, axis=1)\n\n\nA = dfgender_year.loc[dfgender_year['Gender'] == 'male', 'Age']\nB = dfgender_year.loc[dfgender_year['Gender'] == 'female', 'Age']\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2)\naxes[1].hist(A, label='A', color ='powderblue')\naxes[1].set(title='Male Artists')\naxes[0].hist(B, label='B', color = 'lightpink')\naxes[0].set(title='Female Artists')\nfig.subplots_adjust(wspace= .5)\nfig.suptitle('Age Distribution by Gender')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot above, I also explored the age distribution between male and female artists (exlcuding non-binary since their frequency respective to the population of artists was negligible, less than 1%). We can see little difference between male and female artists aside from the significantly larger frequency of male artists overall as both groups tend to live between the ages 70-80.\n\n\nFocused Analysis\nWe can see this collection can provide some general insights about the frequencies of artists’ gender, medium, and age but does not allow us to make conclusions about some underlying historical or cultural factors.\nIn this further analysis, I will be examining some possible relationships in the data based incorporating more text and geospatial analysis to explore the research questions.\n\ndfdept = dfartworks[['YearAcquired', 'Department']].copy()\ndfdept = dfdept.dropna()\ndfdept = dfdept.astype({'YearAcquired':'int64'})\n\n\ndfdeptyear = pd.DataFrame(dfdept.groupby(by = 'YearAcquired', as_index = False, observed = True)['Department'].value_counts())\ndfdeptyear.sort_values('YearAcquired', inplace  = True)\ndfdeptyear = dfdeptyear.sort_values(['YearAcquired'])\ndfdeptyear.reset_index(inplace = True, drop = True)\n\n\nfig = px.bar(dfdeptyear, \n             x= 'Department', \n             y= 'count', \n             animation_frame = 'YearAcquired', animation_group=\"Department\",\n             title = 'Acquisition of Artworks Over Time (by Department)')\nfig.update_layout(xaxis = {\"categoryorder\":\"total ascending\"})\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe above animated bar plot shows the history of acquisitions each year according to each department in MoMA. By pressing the play button, you can see which departments MoMA acquired the most works for in each year.\nThroughout the history of acquisitions, we can see Drawings & Prints dominated most of the acquisitions closely followed by Photography. There are certain years where MoMA decides to acquire a large amount of works for a specific department, such as in 1999 where they acquired over 700 works for their Architecture & Design department. We can also see Photography acquisitions start to dominate from 2016 to today. It appears overall, MoMA has a tendency to acquire more handdrawn and photographed work within a year, and acquire a very small number of performance and film works in a year.\n\ndfmedyear = dfartworks.filter(['Medium','DateAcquired'])\ndfmedyear = dfmedyear.dropna()\ndfmedyear.reset_index(inplace = True, drop = True)\nmedwordstr = \"\"\nfor i in range(len(dfmedyear)):\n    if (not pd.isna(dfmedyear['Medium'][i])):\n        for w in dfmedyear['Medium'][i].split():\n            if w not in myStopWords and w not in numWords:\n                medwordstr += \" \" + PorterStemmer().stem(w)\n    dfmedyear['Medium'][i] = medwordstr\n    medwordstr = \"\"\n\n\ndfmed = pd.DataFrame(nltk.FreqDist(medwordlist).most_common(5), columns= ['Words', 'Frequency']).sort_values('Frequency')\nfor i in dfmed['Words']:\n    dfmedyear[i] = dfmedyear['Medium'].str.count(i)\ndfmedyear['YearAcquired'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(dfmedyear['DateAcquired']).year\n\n\nmedyrplot = dfmedyear.groupby('YearAcquired').sum().plot(kind = 'area', figsize = (12,6))\nmedyrplot.set_xlabel('Year Acquired')\nmedyrplot.set_title('Top 5 Mediums in Artworks Acquired Over Time')\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_285/3647308248.py:1: FutureWarning:\n\nThe default value of numeric_only in DataFrameGroupBy.sum is deprecated.

Either specify numeric_only or select only columns which should be valid for the function.\n\n\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Top 5 Mediums in Artworks Acquired Over Time')\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above area chart shows the relationship of the frequency of mediums of artworks over time the artworks were acquired. We can see there is a large spike in the acquisition of works that used silver and print in the 1970s, and how print continues to dominate until today. This matches the findings with the analysis of the freqeuncy of departments above, where the Museum tends to favour works in print.\nThe most surprising frequent words in this plot are gelatin and silver, so I conducted a search on these mediums and found they actually interact with one another. According to the official MoMA website, many photographers in the 20th century used gelatin silver prints thanks to their “fast exposure times and relative ease of use”. It’s possible the Museum also tended to acquire larger numbers of photography each year since artists could produce gelatin silver prints in large amounts, possibly adding more diversity and nuance to the Photography exhibitions.\n\ndfartworks['Title'] = dfartworks['Title'].str.lower()\ndfartworks = dfartworks.astype({'Title':'string'})\n\ndftitle = dfartworks[['Title', 'Date']].dropna()\ndftitle['Date'].dropna(inplace = True)\ndftitle['Title'].dropna(inplace = True)\nnotyears = []\nfor w in dftitle['Date']:\n    if (not pd.isna(w)) and not w.isnumeric() and len(w) != 4 and w not in notyears:\n        notyears.append(w)\nfor i in notyears:\n    dftitle = dftitle[dftitle['Date'] != i]\ndftitle = dftitle[dftitle['Date'] != \"n d \"]\ndftitle.sort_values('Date', inplace = True)\ndftitle.reset_index(inplace = True, drop = True)\n\n\nsia = vader.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\ndftitle['Title'] = ' ' + dftitle['Title']\ndfsentitime = pd.DataFrame(dftitle.groupby('Date')['Title'].sum())\ndfsentitime\nscorelist = []\nfor title in dfsentitime['Title']:\n        sentiscore = 0\n        for word in word_tokenize(title.lower()):\n            if word not in myStopWords:\n                sentiscore += sia.polarity_scores(word)['compound']\n        scorelist.append(sentiscore)\ndfsentitime['Sentiscore'] = scorelist\ndfsentitime.reset_index(inplace = True)\n\n\ndfsentitime = dfsentitime.astype({'Date':'int'})\n\n\nsentiplot = plt.bar(dfsentitime['Date'], dfsentitime['Sentiscore'])\nfor s in range(len(scorelist)):\n    if scorelist[s] &lt;= -150:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('firebrick')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt; -150 and scorelist[s] &lt;= -100:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('brown')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt; -100 and scorelist[s] &lt;= -50:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('indianred')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt; -50 and scorelist[s] &lt;= 0:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('lightcoral')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt; 0 and scorelist[s] &lt; 50:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('lightblue')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt;= 50 and scorelist[s] &lt; 100:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('paleturquoise')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt;= 100 and scorelist[s] &lt; 150:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('turquoise')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt;= 150:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('darkturquoise')\nplt.suptitle('Compound Sentiment Scores Per Year (Production)')\nplt.ylabel('Sentiment Score')\nplt.xlabel('Year Produced')\nplt.xlim(1890, 2023)\nplt.figure(figsize = (12,6))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 1200x600 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\nThis bar graph visualizes the sum of compound sentiment scores across the years each work was produced. We can see there is a tendency for works produced during the period of 1900-1960s to have more negative sentiments whereas works from the late 1900s to today tend to express more positive sentiments. It appears the Museum tends to acquire older works that cover more negative topics and acquire newer works that provide a more positive outlook.\nThis is interesting because we can’t directly conclude from this that older works tend to be more negative, it is such that curators selectively chose older works that were negative. It’s possible this is the case such that maybe curators might wanted to discuss some sort of history in older works. In the case of selecting newer works that are more positive, curators might wanted to provide more hope to the public with contemporary artists.\n\ndfsentaq = dfartworks[['Title', 'DateAcquired']].copy()\ndfsentaq = dfsentaq.dropna()\ndfsentaq['Date'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(dfsentaq['DateAcquired']).year\nsia = vader.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\ndfsentaq['Title'] = ' ' + dfsentaq['Title']\ndfsentitime = pd.DataFrame(dfsentaq.groupby('Date')['Title'].sum())\ndfsentitime\nscorelist = []\nfor title in dfsentitime['Title']:\n        sentiscore = 0\n        for word in word_tokenize(title.lower()):\n            if word not in myStopWords:\n                sentiscore += sia.polarity_scores(word)['compound']\n        scorelist.append(sentiscore)\ndfsentitime['Sentiscore'] = scorelist\ndfsentitime.reset_index(inplace = True)\n\n\nsentiplot = plt.bar(dfsentitime['Date'], dfsentitime['Sentiscore'])\nfor s in range(len(scorelist)):\n    if scorelist[s] &lt;= -150:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('firebrick')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt; -150 and scorelist[s] &lt;= -100:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('brown')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt; -100 and scorelist[s] &lt;= -50:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('indianred')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt; -50 and scorelist[s] &lt;= 0:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('lightcoral')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt; 0 and scorelist[s] &lt; 50:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('lightblue')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt;= 50 and scorelist[s] &lt; 100:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('paleturquoise')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt;= 100 and scorelist[s] &lt; 150:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('turquoise')\n    elif scorelist[s] &gt;= 150:\n        sentiplot[s].set_color('darkturquoise')\nplt.suptitle('Compound Sentiment Scores Per Year (Acquisitions)')\nplt.ylabel('Sentiment Score')\nplt.xlabel('Year Acquired')\nplt.xlim(1929, 2023)\nplt.figure(figsize = (12,6))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 1200x600 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\nThis graph is similar to the previous sentiment score bar chart, except we are using the dates the works were acquired instead of the dates they were produced. We can see curators have a pretty balanced preference every year, as all the years of acquisition are relatively evenly broken up between positive and negative themes. We can see some extreme scores in the 2000s, possibly where they acquired a large amount of works with positive sentiment. It is of note that the acquisitions in 1940-1960 were mostly negative.\nBased on the previous graph that showed older works in the collection tended to have negative sentiment where newer works expressed more positive sentiment, this graph confirms the curators preference to acquire more negative-coded older works. We can also see a trend in acquistions becoming more positive starting in the late 1900s. This could possibly illustrate a sort of cultural shift in both artists and curators between the 20th and 21st centuries, where they view the 20th century modern artists as old yet artfully melancholic, whereas the 21st century is new and fresh, experimental and hopeful.\n\ndfnat = pd.DataFrame(dfartists['Nationality'].dropna().value_counts())\ndfnat.reset_index(inplace = True)\n\n\ndfnat.rename(columns={'index':'nationality','Nationality':'frequency'}, inplace=True)\n\n\ndfcountries = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/knowitall/chunkedextractor/raw/master/src/main/resources/edu/knowitall/chunkedextractor/demonyms.csv')\ndfcountries.columns = ['nationality', 'country']\ncountrylist = []\nfor nat in dfnat['nationality'].values:\n    foundnat = False\n    for c in dfcountries['nationality'].values:\n        if nat == 'American':\n            countrylist.append('United States of America')\n            foundnat = True\n            break\n        natlist = c.replace(\" or \", \",\")\n        for w in natlist.split(','):\n            if w.strip() == nat:\n                countrylist.append(dfcountries.loc[dfcountries['nationality'] == c]['country'].values[0])\n                foundnat = True\n                break\n        if foundnat:\n            break\n    if foundnat == False:\n        if nat == 'Korean':\n            countrylist.append('Korea')\n        else:  \n            countrylist.append('None')\ndfnat['country'] = countrylist\ndfnat = dfnat.astype({'nationality':'string'})\ndfnat = dfnat.astype({'country':'string'})\n\n\ndfnat['log(freq)'] = np.log(dfnat['frequency'])\nm = folium.Map()\ncountry_geo = f\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium/main/examples/data/world-countries.json\"\nfolium.Choropleth(\n    geo_data=country_geo,\n    data=dfnat,\n    columns=[\"country\", \"log(freq)\"],\n    legend_name=\"Artists per Country (normalized with log)\",\n    key_on=\"feature.properties.name\",\n    nan_fill_opacity= 0,\n    fill_color=\"YlGn\",\n    highlight = True\n).add_to(m)\n\nm\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nAbove is a map of the distribution of artists in the MoMA collections, with darker greens representing more artists from that country. Most artists are from western and european countries, with over 5000 artists being from the United States of America alone. There is a lack of representation for artists from countries in Asia and Africa. However, MoMA does have surprisingly large selection of works by artists from Japan. For reference, MoMA has more Japanese artists featured than those from Russia, Australia, and most of countries in South America.\nIt is clear curators tend to include more western and european artists in their collection, and most of the collection is not representative of the entire world. Furthermore, the nationality can only tell us about artists from different countries, which can tell us some degree about the distribution of people of color but the dataset excludes information about the ethnicity of the artists (eg. most artists are labeled as ‘American’).\n\n#dfgw = dfworks[['Gender', 'Date']].dropna()\ndfgw = dfartworks[['Gender', 'DateAcquired']].dropna()\ndfgw['Date'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(dfgw['DateAcquired']).year\n\ndfgw = dfgw.astype({'Gender':'string'})\ndfgw = dfgw.astype({'Date':'int'})\nfor i in ['(', ')']: dfgw['Gender'] = dfgw['Gender'].str.replace(i, '')\ndfgw['Gender'] = dfgw['Gender'].str.lower()\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_285/3682067671.py:7: FutureWarning:\n\nThe default value of regex will change from True to False in a future version.

I observed in my exploratory analysis earlier that some of the artworks in the dataset were produced by multiple artists, and therefore the ‘Gender’ variable in the artworks dataset included every gender in that group of artists for each artwork. I thought it would be interesting to observe the gender dynamics within groups of artists compared to solo artists in relation to acquisitions. Therefore, I chose to plot two line graphs, one showing the distribution including works by single artists and one showing the distribution excluding solo artist works.\nIn terms of solo works as well as in general, curators tend to select majority of works by male artists. However, looking at the graph excluding solo artists, we can see curators tend to collect more works with female artists who worked in a group to produce the work. This is interesting so I decided to examine these same gender distributions but according to the date the work was produced.\n\ndfgw = dfworks[['Gender', 'Date']].dropna()\ndfgw = dfgw.astype({'Gender':'string'})\ndfgw = dfgw.astype({'Date':'int'})\nfor i in ['(', ')']: dfgw['Gender'] = dfgw['Gender'].str.replace(i, '')\ndfgw['Gender'] = dfgw['Gender'].str.lower()\nmultartists = dfgw.copy()\nmultartists['Gender'] = multartists['Gender'].str.strip()\nmultartists = multartists[multartists['Gender'] != '']\nmultartists['male count'] = multartists['Gender'].str.count('male')\nmultartists['female count'] = multartists['Gender'].str.count('female')\nf = pd.DataFrame(multartists.groupby('Date')['female count'].sum())\nf.reset_index(inplace = True)\nm = pd.DataFrame(multartists.groupby('Date')['male count'].sum())\nm.reset_index(inplace = True)\nmultartists2 = multartists.copy()\nmultartists2 = multartists2[multartists2['Gender'] != 'male']\nmultartists2 = multartists2[multartists2['Gender'] != 'female']\nmultartists2['male count'] = multartists2['Gender'].str.count('male')\nmultartists2['female count'] = multartists2['Gender'].str.count('female')\nf2 = pd.DataFrame(multartists2.groupby('Date')['female count'].sum())\nf2.reset_index(inplace = True)\nm2 = pd.DataFrame(multartists2.groupby('Date')['male count'].sum())\nm2.reset_index(inplace = True)\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_285/1827326518.py:4: FutureWarning:\n\nThe default value of regex will change from True to False in a future version.

We can clearly see the collection is strongly dominated by male solo artists based on the graph including solo artworks. We can see a peak during the 20th century and slight decrease of men solo artists in the 21st century.\nThe graph excluding solo artists presents a different case however. Male and female artists tend to stand on relatively more equal ground in terms of works produced by a group of artists. Women are more likely to be included in the collection when they worked on a piece with other artists, however, entering the 21st century we see the case where men are far less frequently featured in collections when they work in groups (equating to the frequency of women). This could also possibly define a possible gender dynamic in the artistic culture of modern and contemporary artists, such that male artists prefer to work alone where women are more open to work on pieces collaboratively. Overall, women did begin to become more increasingly included in the MoMA collections when they produced works in the 2000s but there is still much progress to be made for female representation of modern and contemporary artists."

    "text": "Discussion\nBased on my analysis, we can identify underlying relationships and trends in the curation of the MoMA collection with respect to the date produced, date acquired, gender, nationality, titles, and medium of the artworks. We can discuss the implicit factors revealed by this analysis that answer our research questions.\n\nHow do the aspects of artworks in the collection reflect shifts in between the 20th and 21st centuries based on the years they were produced?\n\nThe sentiment compound scores compiled from the titles of the works show a shift from negative themes in the 20th century to more positive themes in the late 20th century into the 21st century.\n\n\nWe can also see although men strongly dominate the art scene in the 20th century, women have begun to enter the scene in more significant number later into the 21st century. Women are also more likely to be included in 21st century works that are collaborative rather than solo works. Moreover, men were less frequently featured in a collection when they worked on a collaborative artwork.\n\n\n\nWhat aspects of the artists and their works influence the museum’s curatorial decisions? Based on the date of acquisition, how do these preferences change over time?\n\nThe museum’s collection is mainly consisted of drawings and prints. By looking at the most frequently words occurring in the mediums of the works, gelatin silver prints tends to be a dominating acquisition during the 20th century and curators today still continue to acquire gelatin silver prints today. The reason for the museum’s preference for prints is ambiguous but it can be possibly attributed to the easy preservation and range of art the public can view from photography pieces in gelatin silver print.\n\n\nThe museum tends to acquire older 20th century works that have more negative sentiments to them and acquire newer 21st century works that have more positive sentiments. This could be attributed to contemporary art having more positive themes and modern art covering more darker themes, or it could be attributed to a possible curatorial bias that older works are more ‘meaningful’ to a collection when they are sadder or more negative, and that younger newer works added to the collection should reflect positive themes.\n\n\nThe museum mainly acquires western and european works, with the exception of it’s relatively substantial collection of Japanese works. It lacks works from Asia and Africa.\n\n\nThe museum curators tends to include more male solo artists in ther collections, yet increasingly include more female artists that work on collaborative projects.\n\nThese findings demonstrate there is a lot of improvement that can be made in terms of representation in the Museum of Modern Art. The cultural impact of the museum can influence people’s views on female artists and more artists of color. It’s also interesting to see the difference in sentiments across the 20th and 21st centuries, and I’m curious if this trend will continue as the collections grow. Overall, this analysis was a great look into the possible thought process and factors responsible for curating the MoMA collection and offers future insights into how we can improve representation in museums in general."
